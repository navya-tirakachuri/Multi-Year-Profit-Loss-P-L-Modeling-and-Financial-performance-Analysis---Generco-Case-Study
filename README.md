# Multi-Year-Profit-Loss-P-L-Modeling-and-Financial-performance-Analysis---Generco-Case-Study
End-to-end Financial Modeling and Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L) Analysis using multi-year financial data (FY2016–FY2018), built in Excel with structured data mapping, standardized P&amp;L statements, and insightful financial visualizations.

# Financial Modeling & P&L Analysis (FY2016–FY2018)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end **Profit & Loss (P&L) financial model** using multi-year financial data (FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018).  
The objective was to transform raw, unstructured financial data into a **centralized, standardized P&L database** and generate a clear P&L statement supported by insightful financial visualizations.

This project simulates a real-world financial reporting and analysis scenario commonly handled by **Data Analysts, Business Analysts, and Finance Analysts**.

## Problem Statement
Financial data was available across multiple years in separate formats, making it difficult to:
 1.Perform year-over-year comparisons  
 2.Analyze profitability trends  
 3.Generate a consolidated P&L view for decision-making  

The challenge was to **standardize, map, and consolidate** the data into a single P&L model that enables accurate analysis and reporting.

## Tools & Technologies Used
1. **Microsoft Excel**
2. Pivot Tables
3. Financial Data Mapping & Lookups
4. P&L Modeling Techniques
5. Data Cleaning & Structuring
6. Financial Charts & Visualizations

## Dataset Details
1. Financial Years Covered: **FY2016, FY2017, FY2018**
2. Key Columns:
  a. Code
  b. P&L Account
  c. Partner Company
  d. Partner Company Name
  e. Year-wise Financial Values
3. Data Type: Financial Modeling / P&L Reporting

## What I Did
1. Extracted raw P&L data for multiple financial years into structured worksheets  
2. Created a **centralized P&L database** using code-based mappings  
3. Standardized P&L accounts and partner company details across all years  
4. Built a **dynamic P&L Statement** from the consolidated dataset  
5. Structured key financial line items for comparative analysis  
6. Designed professional financial visualizations including:
  a. Stacked Column Charts  
  b. Donut Charts  
  c. Area Charts  
  d. Bridge Charts  

## Key Insights & Outcomes
1. Enabled clear **year-over-year financial comparison**
2. Improved reporting accuracy through structured data modeling
3. Created a **single source of truth** for financial analysis
4. Simplified complex financial data using intuitive visualizations
5. Enhanced decision-making by highlighting profitability trends and movements

## Business Impact
This project demonstrates the ability to:
1. Work with real-world financial data
2. Build structured financial models
3. Translate raw numbers into actionable insights
4. Support business and finance teams with reliable reporting
